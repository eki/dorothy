= Dorothy

Dorothy is a z-machine interpreter library.  It's core is C (taken in part from
Frotz), the interface is Ruby.  Ideally this project forms the basis for
writing interpreters and other tools.

The two most critical references for this are:

  * The Z-Machine Standards Document <http://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point0/index.html>
  * Frotz's source code <http://frotz.sourceforge.net/>

= Demo

There is a demo webapp that uses Dorothy at iFrotz <http://ifrotz.org>.

= Testing

You'll need the Inform 6 to compile the test programs <http://www.inform-fiction.org/software/index.html>.
